So after a long time, I would like to turn bitter inside through my writings, rather than sugarcoating everything I have experienced at the first semester. This is the reason why I am writing this piece. It was much competitive and harder times compared with my last time. I studied and learned even harder during the semester. But I am scared for the next semester at the same time.
